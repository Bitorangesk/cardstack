<p>This directory is for modules that support <code>../indexers.js</code>, the main code within the Hub that runs all your Indexers and gets content into the search index.</p>

<p>Not to be confused with the <code>../indexers</code> directory, which follows standard Cardstack plugin semantics to define some Indexers that come with <code>@cardstack/hub</code> itself.</p>
