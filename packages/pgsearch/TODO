# Implementation notes for pgsearch refactor

- verify cursor behavior in docsThatReference (either manually or write a test)
- Improve DI system to remove hack where we do require.resolve during injections.
- Switch filter default from non-exact to exact.
- Drop implicit "any" array support inside operators like 'exact'
- readOtherIndexers can become a full searcher, but that involves more sophisticated invalidation queries
- uncachedRead should go away (this is easier to do if we replace readOtherIndexers with a full searcher)
